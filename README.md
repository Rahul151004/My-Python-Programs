I have created this Python Project on making a days surived counter by using Python3.
I used many if-elif-else statements and also made use of for loops to get the required result.
Also made use of if-elif-else statements as to make sure that we could add on the extra day for leap years only if that day had passed which means that we would have to add that day after the second month of February.
